# UK Election Data D3

A revised version of an early experiment in D3. Users can upload the provided CSV files to display UK General Election data in a table and pie chart (with colour-coded legend). The initial attempt several years ago only generated the table, with the pie chart function revised once more experience with D3 was gained. Minimal styling implemented, as the focus was on functionality.
